Folder details:

Application folder:

ConversationBufferMemory folder:	
Two jupyter notebook files explaining the memorybuffer implementaion for our chatbot.

Cloud_deployment_guide folder:
Follow the step-by-step instructions if you wish to deploy the app.py script on the cloud.
Note: I have implemented the azure data factory pipeline for the implementation purpose, but as this survices are not free and I was using vertual machine and data factory services which are chargable ,I have deleted all the resources after the testing .

If you have a subscription(pay as you go / student credit) please implement the services.for now if you want to test the application please go thru the application folder to run the script in the local machine

Jupyter Notebook files folder:	
Go through the implementation on the Jupyter notebooks(same as app.py), execute each shell, and I've added markdown statements for better understanding.
